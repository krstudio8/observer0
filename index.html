                    <p>Observer:0 is a music project that documents existence. Each track is released as a log,
                        observing
                        life, death, and what comes after -- without faith, without fantasy, and without instruction.
                    </p>
                    <p>The lyrics describe spiritual facts as systems: the continuity of awareness, the return cycle,
                        and
                        the motion beyond the body. Emotion is present, but never explained.</p>

Born into this world with something to learn
Hands not empty but not aware

We walk the surface, call it a life, tracing the outline of why we’re here
When the signal fades we don’t end, we turn around

We go back to where we came from
We look back at what we’ve done

Then we return carrying new weight
Different tasks, same motion

Time folds in on itself
Memory without a name
What we missed, what we tried reviewed, not erased
From that side, we understand, then we choose again

We go back to where we came from
We look back at what we’ve done

Then we return with different roles
Different paths, same cycle

Back and forth, back and forth
This world, original world
Back and forth, back and forth
Still moving

Not the first, not the last
Just a pass

We are travelers without rest
Crossing worlds again

Still going, still going

Spirits created, each with a code
Moving along the time-line
Nothing here feels accidental
The shapes keep changing

Signals appearing, fading out
Some stay quiet, some collide
Every pattern slightly shifting
As the moment slides

What the people ignores
Still leaves a trace

If one goes missing
The picture won’t align
Every piece is moving
Changing the design

If one goes missing
The frame won’t hold in time
Every piece is moving
Redrawing the lines

Not random, not spare
Not overflow
Every role unfolding
Before we know

No fixed position
No final name
Just motion repeating
Never the same

What the people ignores
Still leaves a trace

If one goes missing
The picture won’t align
Every piece is moving
Changing the design

If one goes missing
The frame won’t hold in time
Every piece is moving
Redrawing the lines

Not a message
Just a record

The picture won’t align
Without every trace
Still moving, still forming
Finding its place

                            <pre>
All humans possess the power of creation,
given at the moment our spirits were formed.
Not borrowed, not stolen, not limited by time,
a quiet force living inside every mind.

We were not designed to move as puppets,
but to choose our own light, to question, to grow.

We think, we create, we shape what we see,
every choice a signal echoing endlessly.
Free will in our hands, like fire or breath,
God asks us softly: How will you use it to love?

To build or to break, to heal or divide,
the same sacred power turns either way inside.
Words become worlds, intent becomes form,
what we imagine is quietly born.

Not to be controlled, not written in stone,
each path unfolding by choices alone.

We think, we create, we shape what we see,
every choice a signal echoing endlessly.
Free will in our hands, like fire or breath,
God asks us softly: How will you use it to love?

Creation is neutral, love gives it a name.
The power remains, the direction shifts.
In silence, the question returns again:
Is this for myself, or for someone else?

We think, we create, and now is the evidence.
The universe listens when intention moves.
Free will, left undone,
not imposed, but given
not a command, but an invitation to love.
